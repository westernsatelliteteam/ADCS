This folder will contain tests at the highest level of the project that require several modules connected together (i.e. )

TST - Unit Test: a smaller test that tests a unit of the software
SIT - System Integration Tests: tests that modules connect correctly/ meet functional requirements
SPT - System Performance test: tests that a desired performance is met 
SAT - System Acceptance tests: formal tests for the client to run/ rerun to verify claims of the design
